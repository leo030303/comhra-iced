A bare bones Ollama chat client written with Iced and Ollama-rs.
Made in an evening after I couldn't find any Ollama clients I liked.
Minimal feature set, really just used for chatting and storing previous conversations
## Features

* [x] Send chats, streamed responses

* [x] Conversations get saved to json file
* [x] Conversation titles are just the first message sent
* [x] Markdown support for messages

**And thats it!**
